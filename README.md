# NACA-Airfoils

This repository provides tools for generating NACA airfoil points.

The formulation is based on the information found on [Airfoil Tools](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit).

This library supports both cosine and linear spacing, as well as closed and open trailing edges.

See `main.cpp` for usage examples.
